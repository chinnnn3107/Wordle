# How to run the source code

## 1. Install Python
Make sure you have **Python 3.10 or higher** installed.  
You can check your version by running:
```bash
python --version
```

## 2. Install required libraries
In the same folder as the source code, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 3. Prepare word list
Ensure that a file named **WordList.txt** is located in the project folder and contains valid 5-letter English words.
Download it from the link below: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FrfRK-J6drqZlaQkvjYlnkRrYI2J22WM/view?usp=drive_link
After downloading, place it in the same directory as `Main.py`.

## 4. Run the game
Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```bash
python Main.py
```

Once executed, a Wordle game window will appear.  
You can start playing immediately using either your **keyboard** or the **on-screen keyboard**.
